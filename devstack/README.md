# Monasca DevStack Plugin

The Monasca DevStack plugin currently only works on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty).
More Linux Distributions will be supported in the future.

Running the Monasca DevStack plugin requires a machine with 10GB of RAM.

Directions for installing and running Devstack can be found here:

    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/

To run Monasca in DevStack, do the following three steps.

1. Clone the DevStack repo.

    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-dev/devstack

2. Add the following to the DevStack local.conf file in the root of the devstack directory. You may
   need to create the local.conf if it does not already exist.

'''
# BEGIN DEVSTACK LOCAL.CONF CONTENTS

[[local|localrc]]
MYSQL_PASSWORD=secretmysql
DATABASE_PASSWORD=secretdatabase
RABBIT_PASSWORD=secretrabbit
ADMIN_PASSWORD=secretadmin
SERVICE_PASSWORD=secretservice
SERVICE_TOKEN=111222333444

LOGFILE=$DEST/logs/stack.sh.log
LOGDIR=$DEST/logs
LOG_COLOR=False

# The following two variables allow switching between Java and Python for the implementations
# of the Monasca API and the Monasca Persister. If these variables are not set, then the
# default is to install the Python implementations of both the Monasca API and the Monasca Persister.

# Uncomment one of the following two lines to choose Java or Python for the Monasca API.
MONASCA_API_IMPLEMENTATION_LANG=${MONASCA_API_IMPLEMENTATION_LANG:-java}
# MONASCA_API_IMPLEMENTATION_LANG=${MONASCA_API_IMPLEMENTATION_LANG:-python}

# Uncomment of the following two lines to choose Java or Python for the Monasca Pesister.
MONASCA_PERSISTER_IMPLEMENTATION_LANG=${MONASCA_PERSISTER_IMPLEMENTATION_LANG:-java}
# MONASCA_PERSISTER_IMPLEMENTATION_LANG=${MONASCA_PERSISTER_IMPLEMENTATION_LANG:-python}

# Uncomment one of the following two lines to choose either InfluxDB or Vertica.
MONASCA_METRICS_DB=${MONASCA_METRICS_DB:-influxdb}
# MONASCA_METRICS_DB=${MONASCA_METRICS_DB:-vertica}

# This line will enable all of Monasca.
enable_plugin monasca-api git://git.openstack.org/openstack/monasca-api

# END DEVSTACK LOCAL.CONF CONTENTS
'''

3.   Run './stack.sh' from the root of the devstack directory.

If you want to run Monasca with the bare mininum of OpenStack components
you can add the following two lines to the local.conf file.

    disable_all_services
    enable_service rabbit mysql key

If you also want the Tempest tests to be installed then add `tempest`

    enable_service rabbit mysql key tempest

To enable Horizon and the Monasca UI add `horizon`

    enable_service rabbit mysql key horizon tempest

# Using Vagrant

Vagrant can be used to deploy a VM with Devstack and Monasca running in it using the Vagrantfile. After installing Vagrant, just run the command `vagrant up` as usual in the `../monasca-api/devstack` directory.

## Enable Vertica as the Metrics DB using Vagrant

Monasca supports using both InfluxDB and Vertica for storing metrics and alarm state history.
InfluxDB is enabled by default in the DevStack environment.

Vertica is a commercial database from Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
A free Community Edition (CE) installer is available for download.

To enable Vertica, do the following:

1. Register and download the Vertica Debian installer from `https://my.vertica.com/download/vertica/community-edition/` and put it in your home directory.
Unfortunately, there isn't a URL that the DevStack installer can automatically use, so it must be downloaded seperately, and put in a location where the installer can find it when it runs.
The installer assumes this location is your home directory.
When using Vagrant, your home directory will normally be mounted inside the VM as "/vagrant_home". 

2. Modify the environment variable `MONASCA_METRICS_DB` in the `local.conf`, `settings` or `Vagrantfile` file from influxdb to vertica as follows:

    MONASCA_METRICS_DB=${MONASCA_METRICS_DB:-vertica}
